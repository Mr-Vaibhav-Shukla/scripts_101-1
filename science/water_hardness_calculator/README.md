# Hardness-of-Water

```
It is a program designed to calculate the hardness of water for some specified salts present in the given sample but it can easily be converted for every salt by simply increasing the initialisation part of the program which stores data of salts.
```

# Setup
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output  `pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0`
./output
```

# Sample problem
```
A sample of water has following impurities in mg/L: Ca(HCO3)2 = 10.0, Mg(HCO3)2 = 8.0 and Ca(SO4) = 12.0. Find the temporary and permanent hardness in ppm.
```
